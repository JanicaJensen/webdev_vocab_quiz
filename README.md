# webdev_vocab_quiz
This is a multiple choice quiz that will present questions about JavaScript. 

## Setup 
The only setup required should be that one must click the URL to be taken to the site and that it should be opened within a full-width window, as the navigation bar in the header distorts upon minimization. 

The link for the deployed application is here: https://janicajensen.github.io/webdev_vocab_quiz/
The GitHub is here: https://github.com/JanicaJensen/webdev_vocab_quiz

## Usage

The quiz has 6 questions, multiple choice radio buttons, a high score screen with options to save your score with initials. The score auto-populates. It will not allow you to save a score without typing in initials. There is a timer that is buggy (see below)

## Team

* Janica Jackson
* A TA helped me a little. 

## Errors and bugs

The timer does not work in the slightest. I was able to get it working in a million different ways, except for how it was supposed to be. So, it speeds up very quickly. One must click fast to get through to the end of the quiz. I even consulted a TA for this, it is a bummer that I couldn't figure it out.

Technically you could type anything into the "initials" input. We haven't learned how to restrict that yet.
